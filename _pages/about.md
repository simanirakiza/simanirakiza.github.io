I am a 2nd year PhD student (MS/PhD track) in Computer Science  at UMass Amherst. I conduct research as part of the STIMA Lab (Systems Towards Infrastructure Measurement and Analytics) and the e-GUIDE Initiative (Electricity Growth and Use in Developing Economies). I am fortunately advised by Prof. Jay Taneja. My current research interests lie at the intersection of electric power quality, machine learning and non-intrusive sensing. 

Previously, I completed my BSc in Electrical Engineering at Makerere University, Uganda. During my undergraduate, I worked on applying deep learning for enhancing ultrasound guided minimally invasive procedures and prostate cancer severity prediction within the Marconi Machine Laboratory, advised by Dr. Cosmas Mwikirize and Dr. Andrew Katumba. In the realm of electricity, for my undergraduate thesis, I conducted a research study to develop a long term expansion plan for the electric distribution grid in Mbarara, a city in South West Uganda. 

I am particularly drawn to the responsible use of technology to enable equitable access to critical resources for sustainable development.
