I am a 2nd year PhD student (MS/PhD track) in Computer Science  at [UMass Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/). 

I conduct research as part of the [STIMA Lab](https://websites.umass.edu/jtaneja/) (Systems Towards Infrastructure Measurement and Analytics) and the [e-GUIDE Initiative](https://eguide.io/) (Electricity Growth and Use in Developing Economies). I am fortunately advised by [Prof. Jay Taneja](https://websites.umass.edu/jtaneja/). My current research investigates non-intrusive techniques to infer electric power quality.
 

Previously, I completed my BSc in Electrical Engineering at [Makerere University, Uganda](https://mak.ac.ug/). During my undergraduate, I worked on applying deep learning for enhancing ultrasound guided minimally invasive procedures and prostate cancer severity prediction within the [Marconi Machine Laboratory](https://marconilab.org/), advised by Dr. Cosmas Mwikirize and Dr. Andrew Katumba. My undergraduate thesis, that focused on electric grid distribution expansion planning, was advised by Dr Jonathan Serugunda and Dr Milton Edimu.
