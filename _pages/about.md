I am a 2nd year PhD student (MS/PhD track) in Computer Science  at [UMass Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/). 

I conduct research as part of the [STIMA Lab](https://websites.umass.edu/jtaneja/) (Systems Towards Infrastructure Measurement and Analytics) and the [e-GUIDE Initiative](https://eguide.io/) (Electricity Growth and Use in Developing Economies). I am fortunately advised by [Prof. Jay Taneja](https://websites.umass.edu/jtaneja/). My research interests are broadly computational science for social good. I'm currently working on computational imaging for electric power quality measurement. 
 
Previously, I completed my BSc in Electrical Engineering at [Makerere University, Uganda](https://mak.ac.ug/). During my undergraduate, I worked on applying deep learning for enhancing ultrasound guided minimally invasive procedures and prostate cancer severity prediction within the [Marconi Machine Laboratory](https://marconilab.org/), advised by [Dr. Cosmas Mwikirize](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9rlsHzoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Andrew Katumba](https://scholar.google.be/citations?user=APqcOhAAAAAJ&hl=en). My undergraduate thesis, that focused on electric grid distribution expansion planning, was advised by [Dr Jonathan Serugunda](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oeuuubUAAAAJ&hl=en) and Dr Milton Edimu.


In my spare time, I find joy in visiting historical and contemporary art museums, music and hobby reading. My current (leisure) read: [Unbowed: A memoir- Wangari Maathai](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201111.Unbowed).
